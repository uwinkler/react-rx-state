## AppStateHooks

AppStateHooks are functions used to:

- select values from the app state and provide them to a `React.FunctionComponent`
- performe some basic transformations and calculations

## Basic Usage

```code lines=1,4-5
const useAppState = createStateHook(AppStoreProvider);

const Hello = () => {
  const name = useAppState(state => state.user.name)
  const todos = useAppState(state => state.todos)
}
```

or, if you want to simplify and unify the access to portion of your states you utilize a _scope app state hook_:

```code lines=1,4
const useUserState = createStateHook(AppStoreProvider, state => state.user);

const Hello = () => {
  const name = useUserState(state => state.name)
}
```

The app state hook created with `createStateHook` (e.g, the `useAppState` hook) takes a **selector function** (`state => state.name`) as parameter.

## Selector Function

Selector functions are used to select "portions" of your application state.
Depending on your needs you can choose between various selector function types:

- State selector
- Sub-State selector
- Property selector
- Transforming selector
- Computing selector
- Transforming + computing selectors

### State Selector

The state selector function (identity selector) gives you access to the whole state object.

```
const appState = useAppState(state => state)
```

Use it wisley. The component will be re-rendered if the state changes,
no matter what properties you are actually need to render your component.

### Sub-State Selector

Sometime it is handy to select an object from the application state if you plan to consume all of it's properties in your component.

```
const user = useAppState(state => state.user)
// or
const { name, age } = useAppState(state => state.user)
```

Warning: the component will re-render if any property of the selected sub-state changes - which is what you don't want unless you really need all those properties.
Consider to use scoped `createStateHook` function instead:

```
const useUserState = createStateHook(AppStoreProvider, state => state.user)
...
const name  = useUserState(userState => userState.name);
const age  = useUserState(userState => userState.age);
```

### Property Selector

Property selector select a single property (e.g the `name` property) from the app state. They are efficient,
as they only trigger a re-rendering of the component if the property changes.

```
const name = useAppState(state => state.name)
```

### Transforming Selector

Sometime your want to transform the app-state or combine various app-state properties into a single object. You can do so with a simple
_transforming selector function_, which is a fancy name for a simple function that takes the app-state and returns the desired object.

```
const compState = useAppState(state => ({
    userName: state.user.name
    todos: state.todos
  })
)

```

### Computing Selector

Similar to Transforming Selectors, you can do basic computations as well:

```
const todosCount = useAppState(state => state.todos.length)
const todosDone = useAppState(state => state.todos.filter( todo => todo.done ))
const todosOpen = useAppState(state => state.todos.filter( todo => !todo.done ))
```

or with a scoped app state hook:

```
const useTodos = createStateHook(AppStoreProvider, state => state.todos);
...
const todosCount = useTodos(todos => todos.length)
const todosDone = useAppState(todos => todos.filter( todo => todo.done ))
const todosOpen = useAppState(todos => todos.filter( todo => !todo.done ))
```

Computing selectors are efficient. Your component will re-render ony if the result of the selector changes.

Take for example following snippet:

```
const todos = useAppState(state => state.todos)
const aLotOfWork = todos.length > 10;
```

Your compoennt will render every time `state.todos[]` changes.

The next snippet using a computing selector is efficient as react renders the component only if the value of `aLotOfWork` toggles.

```
const aLotOfWork = useAppState(state => state.todos.length > 10)
```

### Transforming + Computing Selector

Of course you can also combine computing and transforming selectors:

```
const compState = useAppState(state => ({
  userName: state.user.name,
  openTodos: state.todos.filter( todo => !todo.done ))
)}
```
