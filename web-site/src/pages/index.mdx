# What is ReState?

_ReState_ is a predictable, easy to use, easy to integrate, typesafe state container for [React](https://reactjs.org/).

<hr />

ReState follows the [three principles of Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles):

- Single source of truth
- State is read only,
- Changes are pure, but made in a convenient way using [immer.js](https://github.com/immerjs/immer)

Futhermore, ReState

- provides a nice React-Hook based API to read and update the state
- is using Typescript to make your application more robust and your development experience more enjoyable
- provide means to develop asynchronous state changes without the drama
- makes it easy integrate other components (server, logger, database, router,...) as
  the state is [reactive](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs).
- dev-tools
- easy to learn and easy to test
