# What is `rx-state`?

**Rx-State** is a predictable, easy to use, easy to extend, typesafe state container for [React](https://reactjs.org/) applications.

<hr />

Rx-State follows the [three principles of Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles):

- Single source of truth
- State is read only,
- Changes are of the immutable state are made in a convenient way (using [immer.js](https://github.com/immerjs/immer))

Futhermore, Rx-State

- provides a nice React-Hook based API to read and update the state
- is using Typescript to make your application more robust and your development experience more enjoyable
- provide means to develop asynchronous state changes without the drama
- makes it easy integrate other components (server, logger, database, router,...) as
  the state is [reactive](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs).
- dev-tools
- easy to learn and easy to test
