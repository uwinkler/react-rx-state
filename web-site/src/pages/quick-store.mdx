To get started, you need to create a store:

```code src=https://stackblitz.com/edit/restate-hello-world
import { createStore } from '@restate/core'

const store = createStore({
  state: {
    name: 'John Snow',
    age: 32,
  }
})
```

<!-- You can learn more about state and store in our guides: <Link to="store">Store</Link> and <Link to="/state">State</Link>  -->

The `createStore` function takes the initial state, so your application always starts in an specified state.

Learn more about <Link to="/api-create-store">createStore</Link>.

<!--
Outside of a react component you can access the state using the `store.state` property.

```
console.log(store.state.name) // Logs 'John Snow'
```

Once inside a store, the state becomes immutable. To change the state (outside of a react component) you can use the `store.next` function:

```
store.next(state => state.name = "John Tagaryan")
```
