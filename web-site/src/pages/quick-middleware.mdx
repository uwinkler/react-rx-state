# Glue Code

Glue code is code that "glues" your store to other parts of the application, for example to your server, database, ...

Glue code can also receive message from the application to trigger some long running asynchronous tasks.

#### Read

Here is an very simple logger example, that observes the state and logs all state changes:

```code src=https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-rx-state-hello-quick-glue?file=index.tsx
function connectLogger(store:RxStore<any>) {
  store.state$.subscribe( nextState => {
    console.log('STATE:', JSON.stringify(nextState, null, 2));
  })
}

connectLogger(store);
```

#### Update

Another example of glue code could be a <a href="https://socket.io">socket.io</a> adapter, that updates chat messages from a server:

```
function connectSocket(store:RxStore<any>) {
 socket.on('chat message', msg => {
    store.next(state => {state.messages.push(msg)});
 });
}

connectSocket(store)
```

#### Messages

Besides observing the `store.state$`, glue-code can also receive messages from the application:
